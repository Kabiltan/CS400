A long, long time ago in a distant, war-torn galaxy...

After leaving the planet Namek, a group of robots fly toward a distant speck. The speck gradually resolves into a floating space castle.

Civil war strikes the galaxy, which is ruled by Ben Beckman, a magic deity capable of planetary destruction with the flick of a finger.

Terrified, a lone Namekian known as Erza flees the Empire, with her protector, Natsu.

They head for Upper City on the planet Alice. When they finally arrive, a fight breaks out. Natsu uses his knife to defend Erza.

Erza and Natsu decide it's time to leave Alice and steal a spaceship to shoot their way out.

In space they encounter a hord of space pirates. Natsu is attacked and Erza is captured by the space pirates and taken back to planet Alice.

Natsu must fight to save Erza but when he accidentally stumble upons a legendary sword in a thrift shop, the fate of the war-torn galaxy changes forever.
